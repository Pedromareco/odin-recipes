Odin Recipes Project:

This project is a simple web application for showcasing recipes created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It consists of several iterations aimed at building a structured HTML file system for recipe pages.

Project Structure:

Iteration 1: Created initial structure with an index.html file containing the "Odin Recipes" heading.
Iteration 2: Implemented recipe page structure by adding individual HTML files for recipes in the recipes directory and linking them to the index page.
Iteration 3: Enhanced recipe pages with images, descriptions, ingredient lists, and step-by-step instructions.
Iteration 4: Expanded the project by adding two additional recipes with identical page structures.

Skills Demonstrated:

HTML: Structured the project using HTML files and implemented proper linking between pages.
File Organization: Utilized directories to organize recipes and images.
Content Structuring: Designed recipe pages with headings, paragraphs, lists, and images for clear presentation.
Version Control: Managed project versions using Git and hosted on GitHub.

Self-Reflection:

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in creating a simple web application and improved my understanding of HTML, file organization, and version control using Git and GitHub. Working on multiple iterations helped solidify my understanding of structuring web content effectively.
