        <h3>Description:</h3>
        A samosa is a fried South Asian pastry with a savoury filling, including ingredients <br>such as spiced potatoes, onions, peas, meat, or fish. It is made into different shapes,<br> including triangular, cone, or crescent, depending on the region. Samosas are often <br>accompanied by chutney, and have origins in medieval times or earlier. Sweet <br>versions are also made. Samosas are a popular entrée, appetizer, or snack in the <br>cuisines of South Asia, the Middle East, Central Asia, East Africa and their South <br>Asian diasporas.

            <small><strong>Yield:</strong> 12 Samosas</small>
        </p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p><strong>Potato Filling</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Boil potato until soft: </strong>Peel then cut potatoes in half. Place in a pot of cold water, bring to <br>boil then cook until very soft, ~10 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Mash roughly: </strong>Remove the potatoes onto a plate and roughly mash with a fork, leaving some <br>large chunks (we want some textural interest)</li>
                <li><strong>Cook spice seeds:</strong> Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds, <br>mustard seeds & coriander seeds. Stir the spices for about 30 seconds or until fragrant <br>- don't let them burn!</li>
                <li><strong>Add the ginger, chilli, peas</strong> and continue to stir a further minute or so until the chilli is soft.</li>
                <li><strong>Add remaining spices: </strong>Add the garam masala, amchur, asafoetida, cumin powder, turmeric <br>and salt. Cook a further 30 seconds.</li>
                <li><strong>Add potato</strong> and gently stir to coat in spices for about 1 minute.</li>
                <li><strong>Cool: </strong>Remove from the stove, stir in chopped coriander leaves. Spread potato mixture out<br> on a plate and let it cool completely before using.</li>
            </ol>
        <strong>Samosa Dough:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> Place the flour, salt and ajwain seeds into a bowl and stir to combine.</li>
                <li><strong>Rub ghee into flour:</strong> Add the ghee or oil and mix with your fingertips until the dough <br>resembles breadcrumbs. (This step is key to making flaky samosa pastry.)</li>
                <li><strong>Form a ball:</strong> Add the water and mix with the flour until you form a ball of dough. It should be<br> pliable and soft, but not so sticky it sticks to your hands.</li>
                <li><strong>Rest 30 minutes:</strong> Cover the dough in the bowl with glad wrap and leave to rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
        <strong>Making the Samosas:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cut into 6:</strong> Cut the dough into 6 equal portions, then roll each into a ball. Keep the balls on a <br>plate covered with cling wrap so they don't dry out.</li>
                <li><strong>Place between paper:</strong> Place one ball on a sheet of parchment/baking paper. Press down to <br>flatten, then cover with another sheet of paper. Do not flour the work surface - it will dry the <br>pastry out.</li>
                <li><strong>Roll out:</strong> Roll the dough into a disc about 2mm / 1/10" thick (~16cm /6.5” diameter).</li>
                <li><strong>Cut in half:</strong> Cut through the centre to create two semicircles (2 samosas per disc).</li>
                <li><strong>Make cone:</strong> Brush the straight side with water, then fold straight edge to join itself and <br>form a cone. Overlap the edges by about 1 cm / 2/5" then press edges to seal.</li>
                <li><strong>Fill with potato:</strong> Make an "O" with your forefinger and thumb, then hold the cone in the "O".<br>Fill with about 2 tbsp of Potato Mixture, lightly pressing in.</li>
                <li><strong>Seal:</strong> Brush the open pastry edge with water, then press together so your Samosa is fully sealed. <br>Place sealed edge down on work surface and press down to fold. Trim off excess <br>pastry, fold in corners. Pinch the top corner to make it pointy.</li>
                <li><strong>Repeat</strong> with remaining Samosas - you should make 12 in total.</li>
            </ol>
        <strong>Frying:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Heat oil to medium:</strong> In a deep pan or pot, heat 5cm / 2" oil to 160°C/320°F.</li>
                <li><strong>Fry 1:</strong> Carefully drop 3 - 4 samosas in the oil and cook for 3 minutes, moving them around<br> occasionally (if they touch the base of the pot for too long, they get brown spots).</li>
                <li><strong>Drain and repeat:</strong> Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining samosas.</li>
                <li><strong>Increase oil heat:</strong> Increase the oil temperature up to 190°C/375°F.</li>
                <li><strong>Fry 2:</strong> Carefully place 3 - 4 samosas at the time into the oil, and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes<br> until they are deep golden. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels. Repeat with <br>remaining Samosas.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve hot </strong>with Tamarind Sauce or a Mint Raita.
                </li>
            </ol>
