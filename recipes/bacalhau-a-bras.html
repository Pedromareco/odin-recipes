        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Bacalhau à Brás (meaning "salt cod in the style of Brás") is a Portuguese dish made from shreds of salted cod (bacalhau), <br>onions and thinly chopped (matchstick-sized) fried potatoes, all bound with eggs. It is usually garnished with black olives and <br>sprinkled with fresh flat-leaf parsley. The origin of the recipe is uncertain, but in its current form it is said to have originated during<br> the second half of the 19th century in Bairro Alto, an old quarter of Lisbon, probably from older and related cod recipes with other names <br>but similar cooking techniques. The name "Brás" (or sometimes Braz, Blaise in English) is supposedly the name of its creator.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>6 ounces boneless dried salt cod</li>
                <li>2 large Idaho potatoes, peeled</li>
                <li>1 quart corn oil (for deep frying)</li>
                <li>2 medium yellow onions, peeled and sliced very thin</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons robust olive oil</li>
                <li>6 extra-large eggs</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon coarsely chopped parsley</li>
                <li>12 oil-cured black olives</li>
            </ul>
            <small><strong>Yield:</strong> 4-6 servings</small>
        </p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Soak the cod overnight in several changes of cool water. Next day
                    rinse the cod well, discard the skin, then with the fingers tear 
                    the cod into fine shreds and set aside.</li>
                <li>Lay the potatoes, one at a time, in the feed tube of a food
                    processor fitted with the fine shredding disc and cut them into
                    long thin shreds. Empty into a large sieve and rinse well under
                    cool water. Pat potatoes very dry on paper towels.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat the corn oil in deep 10-inch skillet or saute pan to
                    380 degrees, then fry the potatoes in small batches, separating
                    the shreds, 8 to 10 seconds until the color of straw. With a
                    skimmer lift the potatoes to paper towels to drain.</li>
                <li>In a heavy 12-inch skillet (not iron) set over low heat, saute the
                    onions and garlic in the olive oil 2 minutes until they begin to
                    color; turn the heat to its lowest point, cover and steam 20
                    minutes</li>
                <li>Mix the cod into the onion mixture, cover and steam 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Quickly whisk the eggs with the black pepper until frothy. Toss
                    half the reserved potatoes with the cod mixture, pour in the eggs
                    and raise the heat to moderate. Scramble 1½ to 2 minutes until
                    softly set.</li>
                <li>Ladle onto a small heated platter, wreathe with the remaining
                    potatoes, sprinkle with parsley, garnish with black olives and
                    serve.</li>
            </ol>
