        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Homemade cheesecake sounds intimidating, but it was actually simple, and one of <br>the first desserts I learned how to make when my husband and I got married because<br> it's so easy!
        <br></br>
        Decorating is a breeze – Simply add sliced strawberries to the top, spoon the <br>strawberry sauce right on, and you're done. It will look impressive, and best of all, it's <br>a make-ahead dessert that takes the pressure off of the host and gets you back to <br>the table to enjoy the company of your family and friends.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>How to Make the Cheesecake</strong>
            <ol>
            <li>Prep: Preheat the oven to 350˚F with a rack in the center of your oven. Line the bottom of a 9-inch <br>springform pan with parchment for an easier release.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine graham crackers with sugar then stir in melted butter. Mix until moistened. <br>Press crumbs into your prepared pan, going 3/4 of the way up the sides. Bake in the center of the oven at <br>350˚F for 8 minutes then cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Increase the oven to 450˚F. Place 2 sheets of extra-wide heavy-duty foil on the counter. Set the <br>springform pan in the center and fold the foil up the sides of the pan ensuring there are no rips. Fan the <br>foil out slightly at the tops to keep the rim clear for rising.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat cream cheese and 1 cup sugar on <br>medium/high speed for 5 minutes until completely smooth, scraping down the bowl as needed.</li>
            <li>Reduce speed to medium and add eggs one at a time, letting them incorporate between each addition <br>and scraping down the bowl as needed.</li>
            <li>Reduce speed to low and add sour cream and vanilla and mix just until incorporated. Pour batter over <br>the cooled crust.</li>
            </ol>
        <strong>How to Bake Cheesecake in a Water Bath</strong>
            <ol>
            <li>Boil a pot of water (boil more than you think you'll need). Set your foil-wrapped cheesecake pan in a <br>deep roasting pan. Pour hot water around the edges about halfway up the sides of the springform pan.</li>
            <li>Carefully transfer the cheesecake to the center rack of the oven and bake at 450˚F for 15 minutes then <br>reduce heat to 225˚F and, without opening the door, bake an additional 65-75 minutes or until the center <br>of the cheesecake wobbles slightly when you jolt the pan.</li>
            <li>emove the cheesecake from the oven and let it rest in the roasting pan with water for 45 minutes then <br>transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Cover and chill in the refrigerator overnight to fully set <br>before slicing.</li>
            </ol>
        <strong>How to Make Strawberry Topping</strong>
            <ol>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, combine chopped strawberries, lemon juice, and sugar. Set over medium heat and <br>bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and continue simmering, stirring occasionally for 20-23 minutes, or until <br>the sauce is thickened. Cool to room temperature then refrigerate until serving.</li>
            <li>When ready to serve the cheesecake, garnish the top with fresh halved or quartered strawberries. Serve <br>slices of cheesecake generously drizzled with the strawberry sauce topping.</li>
            </ol>
